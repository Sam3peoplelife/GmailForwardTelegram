# Gmail Notifications Telegram Bot

### This project is a Telegram bot that notifies users about new Gmail messages, with each user authenticating their own Gmail account via OAuth. 
### Users can set personal whitelists and blacklists for email senders and subjects, and notifications are filtered accordingly.
### All user data, including tokens and filters, is stored locally and notifications are skipped on the first Gmail check after authentication to avoid spamming old emails.

## Managing emails, blacklists and whitelists
